 üéÆ Game Title: Velocity Sphere

 üß≠ Full Game Description

 Velocity Sphere is a next-generation 3D endless-runner where you don‚Äôt play as a character ‚Äî you become momentum. You control a perfectly engineered, physics-powered rolling ball racing through an ever-evolving world of danger, motion, and beauty. Crafted with precision using Apple‚Äôs SceneKit engine and designed with a clean modular architecture, this game merges fluid mechanics with eye-catching design and rich, addictive gameplay.

 ‚∏ª

 üöÄ Core Gameplay

 At its heart, Velocity Sphere is about survival through speed and control. The ball rolls forward automatically down a three-lane track. Your goal: stay alive, dodge obstacles, collect power-ups, and go as far as you can.

 You interact with the game through simple gestures:
     ‚Ä¢    Swipe Left / Right: Shift lanes to dodge obstacles or collect items.
     ‚Ä¢    Swipe Up / Tap: Make the ball jump.
     ‚Ä¢    (Optional future) Swipe Down: Duck under archways or traps.

 The challenge grows dynamically. The further you roll, the faster the game becomes. Every second tests your reflexes, focus, and lane-switching precision. It‚Äôs a beautiful blend of casual-friendly mechanics with deep skill ceilings.
